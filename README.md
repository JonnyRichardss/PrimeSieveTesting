# PrimeSieveTesting
Inspired by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3h62rgewZM and its sequels - this is a clone of the prime-sieve testing

I decided to try this when I came across wilson's theorem https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilson%27s_theorem
However, I failed to realise before starting that I would quickly hit the 64 bit integer limit and my original solution would not work very well
